## Project Description
This project is a real-world demonstration of how to use Python to fetch data from a **public API** and present it using **data visualization tools**. Specifically, we use the **OpenWeatherMap API** to gather real-time and/or forecasted weather data for a user-specified city and visualize this data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
The core idea is to transform raw API data into **interactive, insightful, and visually appealing graphs** that help users better understand current weather conditions and upcoming trends. This project is ideal for students, developers, or analysts looking to improve their API handling, data processing, and visualization skills in Python.

# Objectives
- Learn how to interact with a RESTful API using Python.
- Process and extract useful information from JSON responses.
- Visualize numerical and categorical weather data.
- Create a user-friendly dashboard that presents weather data in an easy-to-understand format.
  
# Key Features
- User Input Interface
- Real-Time Weather Data
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Clean and Readable Code
  
# Technologies Used
Python : Core programming language 
OpenWeatherMap: Source of real-time weather data 
Requests:Sending HTTP requests to the API
